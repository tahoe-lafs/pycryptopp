The following licensing text applies to a subset of the Crypto++ source code
which is included in the pycryptopp source tree under the "src-cryptopp"
subdirectory.  That embedded subset of the Crypto++ source code is not used
when pycryptopp is built for Debian -- instead the --disable-embedded-cryptopp
option to "setup.py build" is used to for pycryptopp to build against the
system libcryptopp.
