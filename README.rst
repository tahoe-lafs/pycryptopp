===========================================================

Introduction and Licence
========================

pycryptopp is a python wrapper around a few algorithms from the Crypto++ and
python-Ed25519 libraries.

LICENCE
-------

You may use this package under the GNU General Public License, version 2 or,
at your option, any later version. You may use this package under the
Transitive Grace Period Public Licence, version 1.0 or, at your option, any
later version. (You may choose to use this package under the terms of either
licence, at your option.) See the file COPYING.GPL for the terms of the GNU
General Public License, version 2. See the file COPYING.TGPPL.html for the
terms of the Transitive Grace Period Public Licence, version 1.0.

The Ed25519 code comes from the python-ed25519 distribution ¹_, for which the
basic C code is in the public domain, and the Python bindings are under the
MIT license. See COPYING.ed25519 for details.

BUILDING
--------

To build it run "./setup.py build". To test it run "./setup.py test". To
install it into your system run "./setup.py install". To create a binary
package run "./setup.py bdist_egg".

If "./setup.py test" doesn't print out "PASSED" and exit with exit code 0
then there is something seriously wrong. Do not use this build of
pycryptopp. Please report the error to the tahoe-dev mailing list ²_.

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

The documentation is in the docstrings. From a command-line, use "pydoc
pycryptopp", "pydoc pycryptopp.cipher", and so on. From within a Python
interpreter use "help(pycryptopp)", "help(pycryptopp.cipher)",
"help(pycryptopp.cipher.aes)" and so on.

The documentation for pycryptopp.publickey.ed25519 is in README.ed25519,
adapted from the upstream python-ed25519 library.

CONTACT
-------

Please post to the tahoe-dev mailing list ²_ with comments about this
package.

BOOK REVIEW
-----------

If you are not already acquainted with how to use modern cryptography, buy a
copy of Ferguson, Schneier, and Kohno "Cryptography Engineering" and read it.
It is easy going and will increase your understanding greatly.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
----------------

Thanks to Wei Dai and the contributors to Crypto++, Andrew M. Kuchling for
his "pycrypto" library which inspired this one, Brian Warner for help on
Python packaging questions, python-Ed25519, inspiration, and a million other
things besides, Greg Hazel and Samuel Neves for Windows porting and fixing
bugs, and Daniel J. Bernstein for Ed25519.
